   <!--It's a good idea to provide an RSS feed of privacy policy updates so that users don't have to keep checking back to see if anything has changed. Especially if your feed doesn't change regularly, it doesn't take much work to update it by hand whenever you make a change. Of course, whenever you make a large change, it's still a good idea to push a notice out to your users, even if you do have an RSS feed. Make sure to remove the RSS section below if you don't use an update feed.-->

     <h4> The Hadith Flashcard app uses Google Firebase Analytics (a product owned by Google) to collect information such as device model, operating system version, and which features are frequently accessed in the app. We use this information to understand user experience and improve the app in future updates. It's important to note that nearly all apps on Google Play Store use Google Firebase Analytics.</h4>

     <h1 id="collecting_email">Collecting Email</h1>

     <h4> The Hadith Flashcard app uses Google Firebase Authentication for "Sign-In" in our app, allowing us to identify your Last Read and Bookmark data by automatically saving it to our server. Therefore, your email address will be indirectly stored in our Firebase dashboard and server. It's important to know that Firebase is a Google product, and Google does not allow developers (including us) to know your password in any way. So, you don't need to worry about losing your email account due to "Sign-In" in our app. We only collect your email address to facilitate the identification of your Flashcard, and we will not share your email address with anyone for any purpose.</h4>
